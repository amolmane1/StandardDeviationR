Imagine an apocalyptic world. Base R decides not to work. sd() doesn't work. It's the end of the world, isn't it?

WRONG. Enter StandardDeviationR. Just do:

    standard_deviation(<input_vector/list>)

A usage example:

    standard_deviation(c(1,2,3,4))

#### Update

Addition of standard error function by Ahu ORAL

**Definition:**

The standard error of a sample statistic (such as sample mean) is the estimated standard deviation of the error in the process by which it was generated. In other words, it is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample statistic.

**A usage example:**

    standard_error(c(1,2,3,4))
